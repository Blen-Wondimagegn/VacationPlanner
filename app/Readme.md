#Vacation Planner Mobile Application

#Purpose
The Vacation Planner Mobile Application is designed to help users manage their vacations and associated
excursions effortlessly. The application allows users to enter, update, and delete vacations, add excursions,
set alerts for important dates, and share vacation details via email, SMS, or clipboard.
The app is compatible with Android devices running version 8.0 (Oreo) and higher.

#How to Operate the Application
1. Entering, Updating, and Deleting Vacations
   Navigate to the "Vacations" section from the main menu.
   To add a new vacation, click on the "+" icon. Fill in the required fields: Title, Hotel/Accommodation, Start Date, and End Date.
   Validation ensures that the Start Date is before the End Date and that the dates are correctly formatted.
   To update or delete an existing vacation, select the vacation from the list, and use the "Edit" or "Delete" options.
2. Vacation Details Feature

3. Vacation Alerts
   Set alerts for your vacation's start and end dates by enabling the alert feature on the vacation details screen.
   Alerts will trigger on the specified dates, displaying the vacation title and whether the vacation is starting or ending.
4. Sharing Vacation Details
   Share your vacation details via email, SMS, or clipboard by selecting the "Share" option on the vacation details screen.
   The sharing feature automatically populates the vacation details for easy sharing.
5. Managing Excursions
